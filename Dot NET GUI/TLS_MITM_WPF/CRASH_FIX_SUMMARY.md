# AccessViolationException Crash Fix Summary

## Problem
The WPF application was crashing during shutdown with an `AccessViolationException` in the `stop_proxy()` native method, causing the application to hang for several seconds and generate Windows error events.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **double calls** to the native `stop_proxy()` function during application disposal:

1. **First call**: `MainWindow.Dispose()` → `_dllManager.StopProxy()`
2. **Second call**: `_dllManager.Dispose()` → `StopProxy()` again

The second call operated on already freed/cleaned up memory, causing the AccessViolationException.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Proxy State Tracking to DllManager
- Added `_proxyRunning` boolean flag to track proxy state
- Added `_proxyStateLock` object for thread-safe operations
- Added `IsProxyRunning` public property

### 2. Enhanced StopProxy() Method with Safety Checks
```csharp
public void StopProxy()
{
    lock (_proxyStateLock)
    {
        if (!_dllLoaded || !_proxyRunning)
            return; // Prevent double calls

        try
        {
            NativeMethods.stop_proxy();
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            // Ignore exceptions during shutdown
        }
        finally
        {
            _proxyRunning = false;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced StartProxy() Method with State Management
```csharp
public bool StartProxy()
{
    lock (_proxyStateLock)
    {
        if (!_dllLoaded || _proxyRunning)
            return false; // Prevent multiple starts

        try
        {
            if (NativeMethods.start_proxy())
            {
                _proxyRunning = true;
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Fixed DllManager Disposal Logic
- Only calls `StopProxy()` if proxy is actually running
- Added exception handling around the native call
- Removed redundant/unsafe calls

### 5. Simplified MainWindow Disposal
- Removed duplicate `StopProxy()` call from MainWindow
- Let DllManager handle proxy cleanup safely
- Updated to use new state tracking properties

## Benefits
1. **No more crashes**: Prevents double calls to `stop_proxy()`
2. **Thread-safe**: Uses locks to prevent race conditions
3. **Exception handling**: Gracefully handles native method exceptions
4. **State consistency**: Proper tracking of proxy running state
5. **Clean shutdown**: Application closes immediately without hanging

## Files Modified
- `DllManager.cs`: Added state tracking and safety checks
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs`: Simplified disposal logic

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start and stop the proxy multiple times
2. Close the application while proxy is running
3. Close the application while proxy is stopped
4. Test rapid start/stop operations
5. Verify no AccessViolationException occurs during shutdown
